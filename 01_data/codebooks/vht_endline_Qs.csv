Your participation is completely voluntary.  You can refuse to answer the entire survey, stop the survey at any time, or you can tell us when a question makes you uncomfortable and we will skip that question. If you agree to participate, I will ask you some questions about your activities in your LC1. All answers are accepted. The questions should take approximately 30 minutes to answer depending on how you respond.  

Risks: There will be no risk for you or your household if you choose to participate in this study and participating will not stop you from receiving services or assistance from any organization.
